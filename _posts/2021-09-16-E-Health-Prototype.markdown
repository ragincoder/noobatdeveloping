People usually being ignorant when it comes to health. However, when they tend to care, their condition worsens or muddles their daily routine. The main reasons are usually lack of awareness, financial problems, and traditional self-diagnosis. Those reasons are what inspired us to create a health care service, especially for university students.

Trying to embed E-health services through the university web portal would be the most effective. Our central focus is university students due to the lack of awareness about the importance of health. The benefits of the E-health services were straightforward health service, affordable prescription, and student health databases for further diagnosis.

There are five features included in the design; Health article, Get your symptom, Appointment, Get medicine, and about the healthcare instances.  We embedded artificial intelligence to help smoothen the data transfer process between the get your symptom feature with the doctor appointment feature. Another benefit was it can give you the nearest diagnosis about your symptom survey results.

Through this E-health feature also the student can get free medicine within the pharmacy under the university cooperation. Whereas; the health instance information features will show address, location, and clinic number.

This E-health web page prototype creates as a university project. While the design was still in the UI stages, I plan to develop this even further. The track of the progress is available on this [link](https://github.com/ragincoder/University-Ehealth-Prototype).
